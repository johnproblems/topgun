## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

**Risk:** Terraform integration complexity across multiple cloud providers
**Mitigation:** Start with AWS/DigitalOcean, add providers iteratively with comprehensive testing

**Risk:** Performance degradation with organization-scoped queries
**Mitigation:** Database indexing optimization, query caching, horizontal scaling

**Risk:** White-label asset serving latency
**Mitigation:** CDN integration, Redis caching, pre-compilation of CSS assets

### Business Risks

**Risk:** Payment gateway downtime affecting subscriptions
**Mitigation:** Multi-gateway support, fallback mechanisms, comprehensive error handling

**Risk:** License bypass attempts
**Mitigation:** Strong encryption, domain validation, real-time compliance monitoring

**Risk:** Competitive pressure from other enterprise PaaS solutions
**Mitigation:** Focus on self-hosted advantage, white-label capabilities, cost-effectiveness

# Task: Add comprehensive deployment tests for all strategies

## Description

Create a comprehensive test suite for the EnhancedDeploymentService that validates all deployment strategies (rolling, blue-green, canary) under various conditions including success scenarios, failure scenarios, rollback behavior, capacity constraints, and edge cases. This testing infrastructure ensures deployment reliability, prevents regressions, and validates that the automatic rollback mechanism works correctly across all failure modes.

**Testing Philosophy:**

The deployment system is mission-critical—failed deployments can cause downtime, data loss, or security vulnerabilities. Comprehensive testing is not optional; it's the foundation that allows us to deploy confidently. These tests serve multiple purposes:

1. **Regression Prevention**: Ensure changes to deployment logic don't break existing strategies
2. **Behavior Documentation**: Tests serve as executable specifications showing how each strategy should work
3. **Rollback Validation**: Prove that automatic rollback works correctly when deployments fail
4. **Capacity Integration**: Verify integration with CapacityManager for resource-aware deployments
5. **Edge Case Coverage**: Handle scenarios like partial failures, network errors, timeout conditions

**What Makes This Task Critical:**

Without comprehensive testing, deployment strategies become fragile and unpredictable. A single regression could cause production outages for hundreds of organizations. By testing all code paths, failure scenarios, and rollback mechanisms, we create a safety net that allows rapid iteration on deployment features while maintaining reliability.

This task creates the testing foundation that will:
- Enable confident refactoring of deployment logic
- Catch bugs before they reach production
- Document expected behavior for future developers
- Validate complex multi-step operations like blue-green cutover and canary promotion
- Ensure rollback mechanisms work under all failure conditions

**Integration Architecture:**

The test suite integrates with multiple components:

**Services Under Test:**
- **EnhancedDeploymentService** (Task 32): Core deployment orchestration
- **RollingUpdateStrategy** (Task 33): Rolling deployment implementation
- **BlueGreenStrategy** (Task 34): Blue-green deployment implementation
- **CanaryStrategy** (Task 35): Canary deployment implementation
- **RollbackMechanism** (Task 38): Automatic rollback on failures

**Mocked Dependencies:**
- **CapacityManager** (Task 26): Server selection and capacity validation
- **SystemResourceMonitor** (Task 25): Resource metric collection
- **Docker API**: Container lifecycle operations
- **Health Check Endpoints**: Application health validation
- **Load Balancer API**: Traffic routing for blue-green and canary

**Test Categories:**

1. **Unit Tests** - Isolated service logic without external dependencies
2. **Integration Tests** - Full deployment workflows with mocked infrastructure
3. **Rollback Tests** - Failure injection and rollback validation
4. **Capacity Tests** - Resource constraint handling and server selection
5. **Browser Tests** - End-to-end UI testing with Dusk (optional)

### Test Strategy Overview

**1. Unit Tests - EnhancedDeploymentService**

Test core service methods in isolation with all dependencies mocked:

```php
it('selects correct deployment strategy based on configuration')
it('validates application configuration before deployment')
it('reserves server resources during deployment')
it('releases server resources after deployment completion')
it('throws exception when invalid strategy specified')
it('logs deployment lifecycle events correctly')
it('calculates deployment progress percentage')
it('handles concurrent deployment attempts')
it('updates deployment status at each lifecycle stage')
it('dispatches deployment events correctly')
```

**2. Integration Tests - Rolling Update Strategy**

Test complete rolling update workflows with mocked infrastructure:

```php
it('deploys application in batches with configurable batch size')
it('waits for health checks between batches')
it('continues deployment when batch succeeds')
it('rolls back entire deployment when batch fails')
it('respects max concurrent deployments limit')
it('handles server unavailability mid-deployment')
it('completes deployment with all containers running')
it('updates load balancer configuration during rollout')
```

**3. Integration Tests - Blue-Green Strategy**

Test blue-green deployment with traffic cutover:

```php
it('deploys green environment while blue remains active')
it('validates green environment health before cutover')
it('switches traffic from blue to green atomically')
it('maintains blue environment for rollback capability')
it('rolls back to blue on green health check failure')
it('cleans up blue environment after successful deployment')
it('handles insufficient capacity for green environment')
it('preserves database connections during cutover')
```

**4. Integration Tests - Canary Strategy**

Test canary deployment with gradual traffic shifting:

```php
it('deploys canary with initial 10% traffic split')
it('increases traffic gradually based on success metrics')
it('promotes canary to full deployment after validation')
it('aborts canary and rolls back on error rate spike')
it('monitors canary metrics during deployment')
it('handles canary health check failures')
it('respects traffic shift percentage configuration')
it('maintains stable deployment during canary testing')
```

**5. Rollback Tests**

Test automatic rollback under various failure conditions:

```php
it('rolls back on health check failures')
it('rolls back on deployment timeout')
it('rolls back on container startup failures')
it('rolls back on resource exhaustion')
it('rolls back on database migration failures')
it('restores previous container versions correctly')
it('restores load balancer configuration on rollback')
it('cleans up failed deployment artifacts')
it('notifies administrators of rollback events')
it('logs rollback reason and failure details')
it('handles cascading failures during rollback')
it('completes rollback within timeout period')
```

**6. Capacity Integration Tests**

Test integration with CapacityManager:

```php
it('selects optimal server using CapacityManager')
it('respects organization resource quotas')
it('provisions additional capacity if needed')
it('queues deployment when capacity unavailable')
it('distributes containers across multiple servers')
it('handles server removal during deployment')
```

    }
}
```

## Implementation Approach

### Step 1: Set Up Test Infrastructure
1. Create test directory structure in `tests/Unit/Services/` and `tests/Feature/Deployment/`
2. Create test helper traits in `tests/Helpers/`
3. Create or enhance factories for Deployment, Application, Server, Container models

### Step 2: Create Unit Tests
1. Write EnhancedDeploymentServiceTest with 10+ test cases
2. Test strategy selection, resource management, lifecycle events
3. Mock all dependencies (CapacityManager, strategies)

### Step 3: Create Rolling Update Tests
1. Write RollingUpdateTest with 8+ scenarios
2. Test batch deployment, health checks, rollback
3. Mock Docker API and health check endpoints

### Step 4: Create Blue-Green Tests
1. Write BlueGreenDeploymentTest with 8+ scenarios
2. Test environment switching, traffic cutover, rollback
3. Mock load balancer and environment management

### Step 5: Create Canary Tests
1. Write CanaryDeploymentTest with 8+ scenarios
2. Test traffic shifting, metric monitoring, promotion/abort
3. Mock metrics collection and analysis

### Step 6: Create Rollback Tests
1. Write DeploymentRollbackTest with 12+ scenarios
2. Test rollback triggers, artifact cleanup, notifications
3. Inject various failure conditions

### Step 7: Create Capacity Integration Tests
1. Write CapacityAwareDeploymentTest
2. Test server selection, quota enforcement, capacity provisioning
3. Mock CapacityManager and resource monitoring

### Step 8: Add Test Utilities
1. Create DeploymentTestTrait with common helpers
2. Create DockerApiMockTrait for Docker mocking
3. Create HealthCheckMockTrait for health check simulation

### Step 9: Run and Debug Tests
1. Run test suite: `php artisan test --filter=Deployment`
2. Debug failing tests
3. Achieve > 95% coverage for deployment services

### Step 10: CI/CD Integration
1. Add deployment tests to CI pipeline
2. Set quality gates (coverage, performance)
3. Configure test parallelization for speed

# Epic: Coolify Enterprise Transformation

## Overview

Transform Coolify from an open-source PaaS into a comprehensive multi-tenant enterprise platform. The implementation focuses on **completing remaining white-label functionality** (dynamic asset system, frontend components), adding **Terraform-driven infrastructure provisioning**, implementing **intelligent resource monitoring and capacity management**, and enabling **advanced deployment strategies**. Secondary priorities include payment processing, enhanced API with rate limiting, and domain management integration.

**Foundation Complete:** Organization hierarchy (✓) and enterprise licensing (✓) systems are fully implemented. Build upon this stable foundation.

## Architecture Decisions

### 1. Hybrid Frontend Architecture (Preserve Existing Investment)
- **Maintain Livewire** for core deployment workflows and server management (existing functionality)
- **Add Vue.js 3 + Inertia.js** for new enterprise features (white-label, Terraform, monitoring dashboards)
- **Rationale:** Minimize disruption to working features while enabling rich interactivity for complex enterprise UIs

### 2. Service Layer Pattern with Interfaces
- **Pattern:** Interface-first design (`app/Contracts/`) with implementations in `app/Services/Enterprise/`
- **Benefits:** Testability, mockability, future extensibility for multi-cloud/multi-gateway support
- **Key Services:** WhiteLabelService, TerraformService, CapacityManager, SystemResourceMonitor

### 3. Terraform State Management
- **Approach:** Encrypted state files stored in database (`terraform_deployments.state_file` column)
- **Backup:** S3-compatible object storage with versioning
- **Security:** AES-256 encryption for state files, separate encryption for cloud credentials
- **Rationale:** Centralized management, easier debugging, backup/recovery capability

### 4. Real-Time Monitoring with WebSockets
- **Technology:** Laravel Reverb (already configured in project)
- **Pattern:** Background jobs collect metrics → Store in time-series tables → Broadcast via WebSocket channels
- **Optimization:** Redis caching for frequently accessed metrics, database aggregation for historical queries

### 5. Organization-Scoped Everything
- **Global Scopes:** All queries automatically filtered by organization context (already implemented)
- **API Security:** Organization-scoped Sanctum tokens preventing cross-tenant access
- **Resource Isolation:** Foreign keys to organizations table, cascade deletes with soft delete support

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components (Vue.js + Inertia.js)

**Immediate Priority - White-Label Completion:**
- **BrandingManager.vue** - Main branding configuration (logo upload, colors, fonts)
- **ThemeCustomizer.vue** - Live CSS preview with color picker and variable editor
- **LogoUploader.vue** - Drag-drop with image optimization
- **DynamicBrandingPreview.vue** - Real-time preview of branding changes

**Infrastructure Management:**
- **TerraformManager.vue** - Infrastructure provisioning wizard with cloud provider selection
- **CloudProviderCredentials.vue** - Encrypted credential management
- **DeploymentMonitoring.vue** - Real-time Terraform provisioning status

**Resource Monitoring:**
- **ResourceDashboard.vue** - Real-time server metrics with ApexCharts
- **CapacityPlanner.vue** - Server capacity visualization and selection
- **OrganizationUsage.vue** - Hierarchical organization usage aggregation

**Payment & Billing (Lower Priority):**
- **SubscriptionManager.vue** - Plan selection and subscription management

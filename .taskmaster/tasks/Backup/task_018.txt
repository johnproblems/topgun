# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement Advanced Rate Limiting
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create sophisticated rate limiting based on organization tiers and usage patterns
# Details:
Build rate limiting middleware with tier-based limits (basic: 100/hour, pro: 1000/hour, enterprise: unlimited). Implement usage tracking with Redis-based counters and quota management. Add rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset) for client feedback. Create rate limit bypass for premium tiers and IP whitelisting.

# Test Strategy:
Rate limiting enforcement tests with various scenarios. Usage quota calculation tests. Rate limit header validation tests.

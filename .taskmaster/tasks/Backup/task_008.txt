# Priority: high
# Description: Connect Terraform-provisioned infrastructure with existing Coolify server management

Create automatic server registration after Terraform provisioning completes. Implement SSH key generation and deployment to new servers. Add security group and firewall configuration for Coolify services (ports 22, 80, 443, 6001). Create server health checking and validation post-provisioning. Integrate with existing Server model and validation workflows.

# Test Strategy:
End-to-end tests from Terraform provisioning to server registration. SSH connectivity tests. Security group validation tests.

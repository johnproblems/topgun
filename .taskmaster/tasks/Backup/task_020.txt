# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement comprehensive system resource monitoring with intelligent alerting
# Details:
Build SystemResourceMonitor service for CPU, memory, disk, and network monitoring across all servers. Create database schema for server_resource_metrics with time-series data storage. Implement monitoring jobs with configurable intervals (1min, 5min, 15min). Add resource threshold alerts with multi-channel notifications (email, Discord, Slack). Create predictive analytics for capacity planning using historical data trends.

# Test Strategy:
Resource monitoring accuracy tests with known server loads. Alert threshold and notification delivery tests. Time-series data storage and retrieval performance tests.

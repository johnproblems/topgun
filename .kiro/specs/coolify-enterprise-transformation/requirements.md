# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification outlines the transformation of the Coolify fork into a comprehensive enterprise-grade cloud deployment and management platform. The enhanced platform will maintain Coolify's core strengths in application deployment and management while adding enterprise features including multi-tenant architecture, licensing systems, payment processing, domain management, and advanced cloud provider integration using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning.

The key architectural insight is to leverage Terraform for actual cloud server provisioning (using customer API keys) while preserving Coolify's excellent application deployment and management capabilities for the post-provisioning phase. This creates a clear separation of concerns: Terraform handles infrastructure, Coolify handles applications.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Tenant Organization Hierarchy

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to support a hierarchical organization structure (Top Branch → Master Branch → Sub-Users → End Users) so that I can offer white-label hosting services with proper access control and resource isolation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an organization is created THEN the system SHALL assign it a hierarchy type (top_branch, master_branch, sub_user, end_user)
2. WHEN a Master Branch creates a Sub-User THEN the Sub-User SHALL inherit appropriate permissions and limitations from the Master Branch
3. WHEN a user attempts an action THEN the system SHALL validate permissions based on their organization hierarchy level
4. WHEN organizations are nested THEN the system SHALL maintain referential integrity and prevent circular dependencies
5. IF an organization is deleted THEN the system SHALL handle cascading effects on child organizations appropriately

### Requirement 2: Enhanced Cloud Provider Integration with Terraform

**User Story:** As a user, I want to provision cloud infrastructure across multiple providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Hetzner) using my own API credentials so that I maintain control over my cloud resources while benefiting from automated provisioning.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user adds cloud provider credentials THEN the system SHALL securely store and validate the API keys
2. WHEN infrastructure provisioning is requested THEN the system SHALL use Terraform to create servers using the user's cloud provider credentials
3. WHEN Terraform provisioning completes THEN the system SHALL automatically register the new servers with Coolify for application management
4. WHEN provisioning fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages and rollback any partial infrastructure
5. IF a user has insufficient cloud provider quotas THEN the system SHALL detect and report the limitation before attempting provisioning
6. WHEN servers are provisioned THEN the system SHALL automatically configure security groups, SSH keys, and basic firewall rules
7. WHEN multiple cloud providers are used THEN the system SHALL support multi-cloud deployments with unified management

### Requirement 3: Licensing and Provisioning Control System

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to control who can use the platform and what features they can access through a comprehensive licensing system so that I can monetize the platform and ensure compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN license limits are approached THEN the system SHALL notify administrators and users appropriately
5. IF a license expires THEN the system SHALL provide a grace period before restricting functionality
6. WHEN license usage is tracked THEN the system SHALL monitor domain count, user count, and resource consumption
7. WHEN licenses are revoked THEN the system SHALL immediately disable access across all associated domains

### Requirement 4: White-Label Branding and Customization

**User Story:** As a Master Branch or Sub-User, I want to customize the platform appearance with my own branding so that I can offer hosting services under my own brand identity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN white-label mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL hide or replace Coolify branding elements
3. WHEN custom domains are configured THEN the system SHALL serve the platform from the custom domain with appropriate branding
4. WHEN email templates are customized THEN the system SHALL use branded templates for all outgoing communications
5. IF branding assets are invalid THEN the system SHALL fall back to default branding gracefully
6. WHEN multiple organizations have different branding THEN the system SHALL serve appropriate branding based on the accessing domain or user context

### Requirement 5: Payment Processing and Subscription Management

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want to process payments for services and manage subscriptions so that I can monetize cloud deployments, domain purchases, and platform usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment providers are configured THEN the system SHALL support multiple gateways (Stripe, PayPal, Authorize.Net)
2. WHEN a payment is processed THEN the system SHALL handle both one-time payments and recurring subscriptions
3. WHEN payment succeeds THEN the system SHALL automatically provision requested resources or extend service access
4. WHEN payment fails THEN the system SHALL retry according to configured policies and notify relevant parties
5. IF subscription expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle service suspension with appropriate notifications
6. WHEN usage-based billing is enabled THEN the system SHALL track resource consumption and generate accurate invoices
7. WHEN refunds are processed THEN the system SHALL handle partial refunds and service adjustments appropriately

### Requirement 6: Domain Management Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to purchase, transfer, and manage domains through the platform so that I can seamlessly connect domains to my deployed applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN domain registrars are configured THEN the system SHALL integrate with providers like GoDaddy, Namecheap, and Cloudflare
2. WHEN a domain is purchased THEN the system SHALL automatically configure DNS records to point to deployed applications
3. WHEN domain transfers are initiated THEN the system SHALL guide users through the transfer process with status tracking
4. WHEN DNS records need updating THEN the system SHALL provide an interface for managing A, CNAME, MX, and other record types
5. IF domain renewal is approaching THEN the system SHALL send notifications and handle auto-renewal if configured
6. WHEN bulk domain operations are performed THEN the system SHALL efficiently handle multiple domains simultaneously
7. WHEN domains are linked to applications THEN the system SHALL automatically configure SSL certificates and routing

### Requirement 7: Enhanced API System with Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a developer or integrator, I want to access platform functionality through well-documented APIs with appropriate rate limiting so that I can build custom integrations and automations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API keys are generated THEN the system SHALL provide scoped access based on user roles and license tiers
2. WHEN API calls are made THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limits based on the user's subscription level
